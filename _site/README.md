A simple yet customizable HTML5 Jekyll theme.
<p>
This theme uses SASS to allow you to quickly change the color scheme and is completely fluid/responsive. It's bare bones and has no external dependencies, I think it makes an excellent starting point for adding whatever sugar you want for your own jekyll theme.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This theme relies heavily on CSS flexbox and so it's not well suited for anyone trying to support IE9 and below.</p>
